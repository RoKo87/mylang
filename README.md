# mylang

This is my programming language (I don't have a name for it yet).

## Built-in functions:
* print(), println()
* ask() - the input functions
* List functions: add(), remove()
* String & List functions: contains(), index(), sub()

## What can you do?
* Declare and assign variables and constants
* Use conditional statements, while and for loops
* Use arrays, queues, and stacks
* Make and call a custom function
* Use arithmetic and logical operators
* Catch errors while running
